# Ricochet Community Patch
This is not maintained, please see my fork of the original SDK [here](https://github.com/ItsiAdam/ricochet-updated).

## Contributing
Whilst I am not the original author nor am I planning to maintain this codebase, I will accept on pull requests where appropriate.

I highly recommend against developing any code against this repository as it is undocumented and lacks a commit history. It should be used solely for reference and 

That being said, if you do develop any code against this repository, as to avoid fragmentation, I would like to consolidate all derivative work on this repository, so please consider creating a pull request!
